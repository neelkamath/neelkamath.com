# neelkamath.com

This is my [personal website](http://neelkamath.com). It's written in HTML and CSS. The tests are written in Dart. No frameworks or libraries were used because the site is fairly simple, and it would be considered over-engineering since by the time I (a non-wev-dev) make a change worthy of removing duplication via React or LESS, new standardized web technologies like ES6 or web components would've been released.
