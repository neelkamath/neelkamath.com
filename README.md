# Documentation

- When adding a technology to the table in the `About` section, check if [DEVICON](https://konpa.github.io/devicon/) has an icon for it. If it does, place the first icon (the font version, not the SVG version) listed for it to the left of the technology's name.
- The _Achievements_ section should be listed in reverse-chronological order.
- The colors for the programming languages listed next to the projects they were used in should be taken from [here](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml).
- Name files using snake_case.
